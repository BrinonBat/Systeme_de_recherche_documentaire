<HEAD>the first test out of all</HEAD>

  This is the first text. talking about future, some things like that. at first, it seams like the word first is very present.
  But, there is also the word second which is good. Now let's some have serious talk.
  We some time might get some regrets, but we shouldn't focus on them.
  Things can't change after all. But we shouldn't forget the past either, so we don't make the same mistakes again.

<HEAD>The second test </HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
  This is the second test. It contains more time the word second than the other texts, but the first document contain one too.
  Here, we'll discuss about students. Well, i'm quite concerned cause I'm one, and there's a lot to say but I'll make it short because it's a test after all.
  Students in Master of Angers makes quite a lot of work, especially because we got a lot of projects. That take kind of a long time.
  I, for exemple, juste used soo many hours (nearly 50) to make this project that isn't even working, making me doing those tests documents.
  Some other students just got good marks on a QCM, that's quite unfair in my opinion.

<HEAD>the third and last test </HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
  This is the third test. Nothing really is written here, but he deserves the purpose of filling a bit. The word nothing should return interestings things tho.
  Now, let's just begin the debugging.
